Install
-------
1. Extract and move the entire direcotry in "/usr/share/amule/webserver/" (or /usr/local/share/amule/webserver, $HOME/.aMule/webserver/), default directory for amule web skins.
2. Now you should be have "/usr/share/amule/webserver/mobileMule"
3. If you want this skin as default, rename 'mobileMule' dir in "default" (not good idea if you have automatic update with something like repository), else continue 
4. Edit row 'Template=' in "$HOME/.aMule/amule.conf" in 'Template=mobileMule'
5. restart amule (or only amuleweb)
6. *(optional)* If you like [Progressive Web Apps](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) consider to install mobileMule under an *https* (eg. [letsencrypt.org](https://letsencrypt.org/)) domain, this enables Service Worker, internal caching and *native* add to home screen.

Update
------
You can repeat point 1 of the above list ([install](#install)) or you can use the internal script ```push2server.sh```. For do that, you must have rsync on server.

> eg. ```push2server.sh user@host:/usr/share/amule/webserver/mobileMule/```

**IMPORTANT**: Remember to clean browser cache if you have some issues (eg. *chrome://settings/clearBrowserData*).
